1. Colour Theory:
take care of color taking into considetarion a mood of website

Yellow: joy intellect attention - advertise for a short perioid of time
Green: Freshness safety growth - grocery company,
Blue: Stability Trust serenity - financial companies, paypal, crypto
Purple: Royal wealth feminity - chwilowki-payday companies

combinations colour palet if you take both colours close to eachother so like red and orange it is harmonius: body of website

sanserif - sensible, simple, straightforward - body text - Humanist typeface is highly redable like gill sans, verdana, tahoma

SIMILAR: MOOD, TIME ERA OF THE FONT
DIFFRENT: SANSERIF-NESS(heading serif body sanserif or the other way around), WEIGHTS

AVOID FONTS: kristen, comic sans, curlz, viner, papyrus

3. User interface design - most important information needs to stand out

layout is important diffrent hierarchy
30-40 characters per line is ideal so around 6 words per line
